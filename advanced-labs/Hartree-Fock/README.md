Hartree-Fock Molecular Orbital Theory
=====================================

This lab activity is intended to teach students the mechanics of the
Hartree-Fock procedure, without getting into the details of calculating the 1
and 2 electron integrals, by using the machinary of the Psi4 quantum chemistry
software package.

Prerequisite knowledge:  This lab assumes that the students understand the
principles, though not the mathematics, of constructing the Fock matrix and
that diagaonlizing the Fock matrix leads to the molecular orbital energies and
coefficients.  The lab also assumes all the [standard python pre-requisites of
all Psi4Education
labs](https://admiring-tesla-08529a.netlify.com/posts/psi4jupyter_labs/).  

Learning ojbectives:
1. Recognize that the AO basis is not orthonormal and must be transformed.
2. Transform a from one basis to another using a transformation matrix.
3. Recognize the interative nature of the HF procedure and what leds to the need for the iterative process.  
4. Define convergence and use convergence criteria in a self-consistent procedure. 
5. Calculate MO energies and coefficients by diagonalizing the Fock matrix.
