# Overview
Psi4Education is the education and outreach program of [Psi4](psicode.org), the electronic structure software package.  Psi4Education offers a suite of online lab activities, suitable for classes across the chemistry curriculum, many of which use the popular [Psi4numpy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy), the Psi4 Python API which allows you to integrate Psi4 functions and commands directly in lab activities in Jupyter notebooks.  Lab activities downloads are avaialable through this GitHub Repo.  For a full description of the lab activities, see our [Psi4Education website](https://admiring-tesla-08529a.netlify.app/posts/psi4education/).
